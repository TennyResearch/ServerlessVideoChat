# What's in this Folder

This folder contains the code as it is at the end of Lecture 22. In this lecture we created two components that
allow the user to select the video input source and the audio input source. Many people these days have more than one
webcam or video source and perhaps several audio sources. These components allow the user to select from these for the video chat.
