# What's in this Folder

This folder contains the code as it is at the end of Lecture 38. In this lecture we build out the UI for selecting the user. In
the previous lectures we added the logged in user to the Connections table and notified all current users of all the currently connected
users. Armed with this information, our UI can now select the user to start the video chat with.
