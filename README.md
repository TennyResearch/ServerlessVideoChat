# Build a Serverless Video Chat App with React and WebRTC

## Welcome!

Welcome to my Udemy course! In this course we will build a complete serverless video chat application using React, WebRTC and a bunch of Amazon AWS Cloud serverless features. This is a great in depth course on a lot of modern and important technologies and I'm so excited that you're here to take a deep dive into these technologies with me.

## Structure of this Respository

This repository accompanies the Udemy course and provides you all of the code and resources we use throughout the course.

For each lecture that we work on code, there is a folder with a starter project. This starter project represents the project progress up to that lecture in the course. If you get stuck in a lecture and you can't get the code to work, just look to the next lecture's starter project and that will give you the final code for the current project. Or, if you just want to move on, you can use the starter project in the next lecture to keep up with the course.

The final project has the complete code at the end of the course. I hope you enjoy this course! Don't forget, if you have suggestions, improvments, or new functionality you would like to see incorporated in the course, just clone the repository, make your changes and submit a pull request.
