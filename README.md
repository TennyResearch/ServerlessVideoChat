# Build a Serverless Video Chat App with React and WebRTC

## Welcome!

Welcome to my Udemy course! In this course we will build a complete serverless video chat application using React, WebRTC and a bunch of Amazon AWS Cloud serverless features. This is a great in depth course on a lot of modern and important technologies and I'm so excited that you're here to take a deep dive into these technologies with me.

## Structure of this Respository

This repository accompanies the Udemy course and provides you all of the projects, code and resources we use throughout the course.

Each folder is named after the project we are working on. Each folder as a starter and final folder that contains the code before and after the lecture. If you get lost during a lecture or can't quite get things working you can aways move on the next lecture and use the starter project for that lecture.

For example, in lecture 7 we start building the helloworld app. In the helloworld-1 folder we have both the starter and final folders. The starter folder contains the code at the start of the lecture. The final folder has the code we had up to the end of the lecture. In lecture 8, we continue with the code in helloworld-2.
