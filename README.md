# Build a Serverless Video Chat App with React and WebRTC

## Welcome!

Welcome to my Udemy course! In this course we will build a complete serverless video chat application using React, WebRTC and a bunch of
Amazon AWS Cloud serverless features. This is a great indepth course on a lot of modern and important technologies and I'm so excited
that you're here to take a deep dive into these technologies with me.

## Structure of this Respository

This repository accompanies the Udemy course and provides you all of the projects, code and resources we use throughout the course. The structure of the
course is mirrored in the structure of this repository. Each section of the course is represented as a folder in this repository. The projects for each section are in a folder here with the same name.

Each folder has both a 'starter' folder and a 'final' folder. The starter folder has the initial scallfolding for the project or if it's a project we are continuing from a previous section, the code up that that point in the course.

The final folder has either the finished project or the project up to the end of the course section. For the projects in progress, we'll continue them in a subsequent section as the starter project in that later section. Some sections have more than one project.
