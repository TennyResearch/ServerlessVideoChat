# Build a Serverless Video Chat App with React and WebRTC

## Welcome!

Welcome to my Udemy course! In this course we will build a complete serverless video chat application using React, WebRTC and a bunch of Amazon AWS Cloud serverless features. This is a great in depth course on a lot of modern and important technologies and I'm so excited that you're here to take a deep dive into these technologies with me.

## Structure of this Respository

This repository accompanies the Udemy course and provides all of the code and resources we use throughout the course.

For each lecture that we work on code, there is a folder with the lecture's final project. This project represents the project progress up to the end of that lecture in the course. If you get stuck in a lecture and you can't get the code to work, just look to the lecture's project and that will give you the final code for the lecture. Or, if you just want to move on, you can use the project in the lecture to keep up with the course.

The final lecture has the complete code at the end of the course. I hope you enjoy this course!

Make sure you run: **npm install** in the canary folder to install the dependencies!

Don't forget, if you have suggestions, improvments, or new functionality you would like to see incorporated in the course, just send me an email at: tennyresearch@gmail.com. If you make changes, extensions or other improvements that you would like to share with other students, just clone the repository, grab the code for the lecture you want to change, make your changes and send me a link to your repository. I'll link it in Student Contributions. Thanks!
