# What's in this Folder

This folder contains the code as it is at the end of Lecture 16. In this lecture we completed
the Login component. This Login component is something of a placeholder. It doesn't really do much more
than provide a bit of UI indicating a login and provide an anchor point for the connection setup process
that happens right after the authentication process.

In Section 9 we will implement a complete and secure login process with the help of AWS Cognito. When we do that,
we will replace this Login component.
