# What's in this Folder

This folder contains the code as it is at the end of Lecture 20. In this lecture we created the
LocalStream and RemoteStream components. This components handle the UI part of the local and remote
media streams. These two components are identical but we intentionally build separate implementatsions so that
we can more easily present different UI appearances for the local and remote media in future versions.
