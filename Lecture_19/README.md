# What's in this Folder

This folder contains the code as it is at the end of Lecture 19. In this lecture we created the AppStateProvider.
This context holds a lot of the core application-wide state information. By pushing this global state information
into this context we simplify the code and almost eliminate the need to pass props around to components.
